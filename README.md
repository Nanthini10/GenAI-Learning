# LLM Projects

Personal project collection to understand how LLMs work. Will draw from various open-source project collections to get a clear picture of the various concepts that are becoming increasingly popular in the field.

If there is time, I'll create slides or one-pagers that can elaborate on the concepts. 


### Concepts

1. NLP basics

    a. Text preprocessing, tokenization, POS, NER, etc.
2. NLP tasks

    a. Sentiment Analysis, Text classification, etc.
3. LLM concepts

    a. Transformer architecture 

    b. BERT, GPT

    c. Understand how LLMs are pretrained.

    d. Fine Tuning - example notebook [Text Classification](01_fine_tuning_text_classification.ipynb)
